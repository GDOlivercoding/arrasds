20 year age difference! But i'll assume a safe 15 year old difference, as the third youngest submittor was 13 years old

It seems like people are really diverse in their tank favorites!

**7 people picked an arms race tank regardless of the "no arms race" text, rendering their pick useless.**

## Most hated tanks: 

### 1st: Overlord with 8 votes, very understandable due to its power

#### 2th/3rd: Factory and Auto Spawner with 4 votes, again, both are very powerful, suprising to see both with the same count since factory is much weaker outside ffa like modes

4/5/6th: Engineer, Penta Shot and Fork with 2 votes
Engineer's pillbox bullets being annoying # A part of my vote
Pentashot being unkillable
And fork will its magical splash

`NOTE: I excluded fork votes made by dreadnought players.
1 was excluded, 1 is from a dv1 player and 1 is from a growth player
so you may exclude this tank completely.`

Rest of these tanks got 1 vote:

    Spreadshot
    Annihilator
    Spawner
    Pounder classes (all) --- Special case for my guy lol
                          You can consider this as a vote
                          to Annihilator if you want
    Auto 4
    Stalker
    Crossbow
    Big Cheese
    Fortress    --- Also my vote, its not powerful, 
                but very defensive, with the drones being undodgable

## Favorite modes:

### 1st: The most favorite mode by far, being mentioned 5 times, was Capture the Flag! I voted for this myself! I can definitely see why this is top 1

#### 2th/3rd/4/5th: FFA, 2TDM, 4TDM and Arms Race Siege all got 3 votes. The first three ones are the regular ones, and i agree with the last one. Ar siege can be fun and stressless (maybe not lol)

##### 6/7/8/9/10/11th: Siege, Tetromino, Maze FFA, Clan Wars and dv1 all got 2 votes. Tetromino should've been higher, i voted for it >:C

For the sake of your curiosity, here is all the other cursed modes that only got 1 vote:

    Normal
    Domination
    Maze
    Maze 2Tdm
    Maze Open 3Tdm
    Arms Race Maze Clan Wars
    Arms Race Growth
    Overgrowth
    Growth Clan Wars
    Arms Race Growth Clan Wars
    Squads
    2Tdm Maze Domination
    Growth Arms Race Clan Wars

    Growth
    Arms Race Maze 2Tdm
    2 Team Maze Domination
    Space
    Arms Race Assault
    Growth Manhunt
    Arms Race

As you can see, a lot of these can be merged
theres a better comparison below:

## Favorite mode tags:
`(This refers to the words used to describe modes, like 'growth')`

### 1st: Maze with 11 votes. people like maze, whether its arms race overgrowth clan wars magic maze trainwars soccer portal 4TDM or just ffa, they like maze, i voted for maze with "FFA maze" too

#### 2nd: Arms Race with 10 votes, Further down this file, you'll see that a lot of people like arms race, not too much, but slightly, this just solidifies that claim in stone

##### 3rd/4th: FFA and 2TDM with 7 votes, FFA is the absolute standard, no comment, ones a classic, 2tdm was actually supposed to have, 2 less votes, but there were some badly typed, tags, and it just came up lol

##### 5th/6th: Clan Wars and Growth got 6 votes, the first is fun (sometimes) (questionable), the second, is ok.... i dont like growth, its more like the children of arras, voted for growth real

###### 6th/7th: Capture the Flag and Siege with 5 votes. We've seen the first one already, and the second one is just beatifully careless

The rest of the tags:

    3 votes:

    Domination
    4TDM

## Opinions on growth and arms race:

``surprisingly, growth opinions are very diverse, well are they?``

### 1st: Growth modes are the modes i play the most with 9 votes this is just a bunch of kiddos who like growth just for the power after grinding for 15h, i get it lol

#### 2nd: I dont like them with 8 votes, this is the opinion of majority of people, and i agree

##### 3rd/4th: They should be removed and I dont mind them with 7 votes: the first one comes with the opinion that it drives away people from normal modes the second one is purely neutral, nothing to say

**I love them 1 vote, no words, this person just loves growth i guess**

## arms race:

### 1st: I like them with 13 votes, i agree, it isnt really good, but fun, because of the amount of options there is

#### 2nd: I dont mind them with 8 votes
#### 3rd: Arms Race modes are the modes i play the most: 6
#### 4th: I hate them: 2
#### 5th: I dont like them: 2
#### 6th: I love them: 1
